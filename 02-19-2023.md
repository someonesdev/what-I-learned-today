### 1. Set()
We can use the set() method to create objects with unique values (meaning that there can't be two of the same.

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3];
let arrayUnique = new Set(array); // 1, 2, 3
```

Sets are iterable and work kind of like an array. But there are some differences too, like their methods, which are pretty much self explanatory:

```javascript
arrayUnique.add()
arrayUnique.delete()
arrayUnique.clear()
```
