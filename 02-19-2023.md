### 1. Set()
We can use the set() method to create objects with unique values (meaning that there can't be two of the same.

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3];
let arrayUnique = new Set(array); // 1, 2, 3
```

Sets are iterable and work kind of like an array. But there are some differences too, like their methods, which are pretty much self explanatory:

```javascript
arrayUnique.size()
arrayUnique.has()
arrayUnique.values()
arrayUnique.entries()
arrayUnique.add()
arrayUnique.delete()
arrayUnique.clear()
```

### 2. Map()
Maps work like objects (they both have keys and values), but unlike objects, Maps can have arrays or other objects as keys. Also, since they have their own set of methods, the values will always be kept in the order they were added to the map.

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3];
let map = new Map();
map.set(1, array);
map.set("key", "value");
```

They also have their own set of methods, pretty much the same as sets:

```javascript
map.set()
map.get()
map.has()
map.delete()
map.clear()
map.keys()
map.values()
map.entries()
```
