### 1. Function Declarations vs Function Expressions

Basically, declarations start with the "function" keyword, they are automatically hoisted to the top, and can be used as constructors with the "new" operator.

### 2. IIFEs

"Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) are exactly that: a function that is executed immediately after being defined. The practical uses of IIFEs are not entirely clear to me yet...

To create an IIFE, simply wrap the function definition in parentheses and then immediately invoke it by calling it with another set of parentheses

``` javascript
(function () {
// Code to be executed immediately;
})();
```

### 3. setTimeout()

We can delay the execution of something using this method.


``` javascript
setTimeout(() => {
// Code to be executed after 1,000 ms.
}, 1000);

```
