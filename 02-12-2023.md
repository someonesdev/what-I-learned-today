### 1. toString() / parseInt()

We use those to convert a number into an string, or a string into a number.

### 2. Prototype system

They are used to create objects that inherit properties and methods from a parent object.

Define a constructor function:

``` javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
```
Add a method to the Person prototype:
```javascript
Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
};
```

We create a new object using the prototype, hence inheriting it's methods.

``` javascript
var john = new Person("John");
john.sayHello(); // logs "Hello, my name is John"
```
