### 1. Spread/Rest

We can "spread" the content of an object/array/string into a new string. It can be used in functions too, in order to pass an array as individual arguments.

``` javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3]
let newArray = [...array, 4, 5] // Will log: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The "rest" works kind of the same, but backwards. It is used to assign the remainder items of an element into an array.

``` javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [first, second, ...rest] = array;

console.log(first); // 1
console.log(second); // 2
console.log(rest); // [3, 4, 5]
```

### 2. Short-circuiting

We can stop a process as fast as the result can be evaluated by using the && and || operators.

With || the evaluation continues until it finds a truthy value:
```javascript
console.log(1 || 2 || true || false) // 1
```

With && the evaluation continues until it finds a falsy value:

```javascript
console.log(1 && 2 && true && false) // false
```

We can use them to set default values. If the "pets" attribute doesn't exist, it will be created.

```javascript
  let object = { name: "J", age: 35, Github: "someonesdev"}
  object.pets = object.pets || "Cats";
```


```
