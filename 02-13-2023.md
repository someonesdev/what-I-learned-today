### 1. Spread/Rest

We can "spread" the content of an object/array/string into a new string. It can be used in functions too, in order to pass an array as individual arguments.

``` javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3]
let newArray = [...array, 4, 5] // Will log: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The "rest" works kind of the same, but backwards. It is used to assign the remainder items of an element into an array.

``` javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [first, second, ...rest] = array;

console.log(first); // 1
console.log(second); // 2
console.log(rest); // [3, 4, 5]
```


### 2. Short-circuiting (&&, ||, ??)

We can stop a process as fast as the result can be evaluated by using the && and || operators.

With || the evaluation continues until it finds a truthy value, and returns it:
```javascript
console.log(1 || 2 || true || false) // 1
```

With && the evaluation continues until it finds a falsy value or reaches the last operand :

```javascript
console.log(1 && 2 && true && false) // false
```

We can use them to set default values. If the "pets" attribute doesn't exist, it will be created.

```javascript
  let object = { name: "J", age: 35, Github: "someonesdev"}
  object.pets = object.pets || "Cats";
```

The ??  allows us to assign a default value to a variable if the value is either ```null``` or ```undefined```, but not if the value is false, 0, "", or NaN.


### 3. Logical assignment operators (&&=, ||=, ??+)

These ones are very interesting.

```javascript
const person1 = {
    name: "David",
    age: 20,
  };

  const person2 = {
    name: "Laurie",
    career: "Singer",
  };
  ```

If the attribute exists, it remains unchanged. If it doesn't exists, it gets created.

```javascript
person1.career ||= "Software engineer"; // "Software engineer"
```

If the attribute exists and is truthy, it gets changed. If it doesn't exists or is falsy, nothing happens.

```javascript
person2.career &&= "Software Engineer"; // "Software engineer"
```

If the attribute exists, it remains unchanged. If it doesn't exist or is null or undefined it gets created.

```javascript
person2.age ??= 30; // 30;
```
