### 1. Spread/Rest

We can "spread" the content of an object/array/string into a new string. It can be used in functions too, in order to pass an array as individual arguments.

``` javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3]
let newArray = [...array, 4, 5] // Will log: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The "rest" works kind of the same, but backwards. It is used to assign the remainder items of an element into an array.

``` javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [first, second, ...rest] = array;

console.log(first); // 1
console.log(second); // 2
console.log(rest); // [3, 4, 5]
```
