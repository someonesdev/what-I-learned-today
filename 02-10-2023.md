### 1. Function Declarations vs Function Expressions

Basically, declarations start with the "function" keyword, they are automatically hoisted to the top, and can be used as constructors with the "new" operator.

### 2. IIFEs

"Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) are exactly that: a function that is executed immediately after being defined. The practical uses of IIFEs are not entirely clear to me yet...

To create an IIFE, simply wrap the function definition in parentheses and then immediately invoke it by calling it with another set of parentheses

``` javascript
(function () {
// Code to be executed immediately;
})();
```

### 3. setTimeout()

We can delay the execution of something using this method.


``` javascript
setTimeout(() => {
// Code to be executed after 1,000 ms.
}, 1000);

```

### 4. Scope chain vs Call stack

The SC is the order in which functions are written in the code. (The variable lookup only works upwards).
The CS is the order in which functions were called.

### 5. Hoisting

```const```, ```let``` and ```var``` are going to be hoisted to the top of the scope, like function declarations, but accessing ```let``` or ```const``` before they are initialized will result in a <i>ReferenceError</i>, while accessing ```var``` before it is initialized will return <i>undefined</i>.

### 6. Primitives and objects

Primitive values are saved in the call stack, but objects are saved in the memory heap. This could be a problem when we want to copy an object's attributes into a new object: since the values are saved in the heap, both object's would share the same ID, meaning that if we wanted to update the values of the new object's attributes we would be changing the values for both, the old Object and the new Object.

We can move past this using the ```Object.assign``` method, as in:

``` javascript

let newObject = Object.assign({}, originalObject);

```

This will copy the attributes of the ```originalObject``` into the ```newObject```.
