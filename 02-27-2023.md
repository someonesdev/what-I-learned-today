### 1. .filter()
Array method that returns an array that includes the items that passed a filter:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let filtered = numbers.filter((element) => element >= 3); // [3, 4, 5]
```

We can also loop through an object's properties:
```javascript
let users = [
    { name: 'John', age: 30 },
    { name: 'Jane', age: 25 },
    { name: 'Bob', age: 40 }
  ];

let over30 = users.filter(item => item.age >= 30) // [{name: "John", age: 30} {name: "Bob", age: 40}]
```
