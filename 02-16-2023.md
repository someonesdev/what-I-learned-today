### 1. clamp()
The clamp() function in CSS is like putting a limit on a number. You set a lowest number, a highest number, and the number you want to use in the middle. This function needs three things: the lowest number, the number you want to use, and the highest number it can be.


### 2. Enhanced  Object Literals
Using enhanced object literals we can put an object inside another object without having to write extra code, all we have to do is write the name of the first object inside of the second object:

```javascript
let smallObject = {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3};

let bigObject = {
  numbers: [1, 2, 3],
  smallObject
}
```
### 3. Object.keys / Object.values / Object.entries
We can iterate through an object using normal loops if we define the object keys inside the function.

```javascript
let smallObject = {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3};

for (let key of Object.keys(smallObject)) {
  console.log(key); // one, two, three
}
```

It works the same for values:

```javascript
  for (let key of Object.values(smallObject)) {
    console.log(key); // 1, 2, 3
  }
 ```
 
 Or for entries, meaning both at the same time:
 ```javascript
  for (let key of Object.entries(smallObject)) {
    console.log(key); // {["one", 1], ["two", 2], ["three", 3]
  }
 ```
