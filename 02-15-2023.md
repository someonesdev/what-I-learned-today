### 1. .isArray()

Since the typeOf would return "Object" for arrays, we can use the method .isArray() to know if an object is an array.

### 2. reduce()

I think this is the first big one. A difficult one I mean.

```javascript
function sum(array) {
return array.reduce((accumulator, item) => accumulator + item, 0);
}
```

The reduce() method works kind of like a loop cycle. The functioon takes an ```accumulator``` (total) and an ```item``` as arguments, and then proceeds to execute the tasks inside the {} for each element. This means that in a simple "sum" function, it will add the first ```item``` to the ```accumulator``` (which most of the times is started as a 0 but it can also start as  an empty object), then the total will become the ```accumulator``` for the next iteration, and so on and so forth until the end of the array.

This function will the return the number of strings, integers and objects inside an array using the reduce() method.
```javascript
function countTypes(array) {
  return array.reduce(
    (count, value) => {
      if (typeof value === "number") {
        count.numbers += 1;
      } else if (typeof value === "string") {
        count.strings += 1;
      } else if (typeof value === "object") {
        count.objects += 1;
      }
      return count;
    },
    { numbers: 0, strings: 0, objects: 0 }
  );
}
```

 Impressive.
