### 1. RegEx

This one is going to be long and hard. Regular expressions (RegEx) are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. They are used to match and manipulate text and they create weird and almost unreadably long strings.

Glossary:
```
/^a/ = Starts with "a".
/a$/ = Ends with an "a".
/^a$/ = Starts and ends with an "a", and it's a one letter word.
/a*/ = It might have one or many "a".
/^a*/ = It might start with one or many "a"s.
/^a+/ = Starts with at least one "a".
/^a+e?/ = Starts with at least one "a" and may or may not contain one "e".

/a{1, 2}/ = Contains at least one "a", with a maximun of two "a"s.
/a{1,}/ = At least one "a", doesn't matter how many "a"s are in the string.

/word\b/ = Contains an specific word.
/^word\b/ = Starts with the word (nothing before or after it).
/word\b$/ = Ends with the word (can have anything before it).
```
