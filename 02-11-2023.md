### 1. endsWith()

String method to check if a string ends with X.

### 2. Concise Object Literal Declaration

Shorthand syntax to create new objects using arguments as attributes. This arrow function defines a person object that takes two arguments: name and age. The function returns an object, which includes two properties: name and age, based on the arguments passed to the function.

```javascript
let person = (name, age) => ({ name, age });
let newPerson = person("John", 13);
```
### 3. Destructuring arrays

We can extract values from arrays and assign them to variables

``` javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Create an "array" with the new variables and point it at the original array.

```javascript
let [one, , three, , five] = array;
console.log(one, three, five);
```

We can also use it to switch values inside variables:

```javascript
[main, secondary] = [secondary, main];
```
